# Introduction

This is a project meant to prototype the *symbiotic learning* paradigm using a brain tumor dataset.

All details regarding the dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mylee77/brain-tumor-mri-deduplicated-clean-version).

# Instructions

First, run the following to retrieve the symbiotic-learning package and create the logs directory:
`git clone https://github.com/bsimon717/symbiotic-learning.git`
`mkdir sym_logs`

Hyperparameters can be specified using command-line arguments (run `python train.py --help` to see the full list) or with a `config.json` file.

To generate a configuration file, run the following:
`python train.py -n 3 -c 0.5 0.5 0.5 -o True --comment='default'`

This will generate a config.json file in the relevant log directory, the path to which will be printed to the terminal.

To start a training with a configuration file, run:
`python train.py --config_path=PATH/TO/CONFIG`

To save the state directories of pre-Readout models BEFORE uplift, use the `--save_before_uplift` flag.

To save all models at the end of training, use the `--save_end` flag.

To start a training AT uplift, use both of the `--load_at_uplift` and `--load_path` arguments.

## Architecture of Prototype Symbiotic Uplift Network
### Definitions
- Symbiotic Learning: A learning paradigm for simultaneously training multiple machine-learning models in which collaboration between models is intrinsic and incentivized.
- Symbiotic Uplift Network: An aggregate network of machine-learning models trained using symbiotic learning. Training begins with a number of sub-models that are encouraged (via coupled loss functions) to collaborate while simultaneously diversifying their assessments. After a specified number of epochs (termed the "uplift" epoch), a Readout block is appended to the network whose task is to intelligently aggregate the perspectives of the preceding models. Also at uplift, the pre-Readout models receive an additional term in their loss functions proportional to the loss of the Readout block for further fine-tuning.
- Collaboration Parameters ($\alpha,\beta,\gamma$): Coupling constants (hyperparameters) in the symbiotic loss functions of pre-Readout models. Must be in the range $[0,1]$
- Personal Loss: A term in a pre-Readout model's symbiotic loss function computed only using that model's prediction. Task-specific.
- Embedding Loss: A contrastive term in a pre-Readout model's symbiotic loss function which encourages diverse initial assessments. *EmbedSim* is defined to be the cosine similarity function scaled to the range $[0,1]$, $N$ is the total number of pre-Readout models, and $\delta$ is a temperature hyperparameter shared between all pre-Readout models.
  
$$ L_{embed,i} = \frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{j \neq i}[\exp{(EmbedSim(x_i, x_j)/\delta)-1}] $$

- Symbiotic Loss: A pre-Readout model's multi-objective loss function. Collaboration parameters enable coupling of models' loss functions such that 1) an individual model's parameters will also be updated based on the other models' personal losses, and 2) diversity of perspective is encouraged via Embedding Loss. 

$$ L_{sym,i} = (1-\alpha_i)L_i + \alpha_i(\sum_{j \neq i}{L_j}) + \alpha_{i}^{2}L_{embed,i} $$

 (Note: The only learnable parameters affected by this coupling are those used in the initial embedding blocks.)
 
 After uplift, the loss of the Readout model is included via the addition of the following "blame" term, where $\lambda$ is termed a "responsibility" hyperparameter shared between all pre-Readout models:

$$ \lambda*(\frac{L_i}{\sum L_i})_{detach}*L_F $$

- Readout Loss: A loss function specific to the Readout block which penalizes it the lower the sum of pre-Readout personal losses is, where $L_F$ is its personal loss, and $\tau$ is a temperature hyperparameter.

$$ L_{Readout} = L_F (1+\exp[-\tau(\sum L_i)]) $$
